# ⚙️ Working Principle

## Line Following

* IR sensors detect the black line
* Robot moves forward, left, or right based on sensor input
* Robot automatically recovers if line is lost

## Obstacle Avoidance

* Ultrasonic sensors measure distance continuously
* Robot stops when obstacle detected
* Robot chooses safest direction automatically
